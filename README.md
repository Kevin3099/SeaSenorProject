<h2> Information </h2>

Welcome to our version of the MagicMirror application to which we have edited to be a sea and weather monitoring application that is updated in real time. The aim of this is to provide one main place for boat clubs, swimmers, divers and whoever else may use the sea one place to find all the information they need! The changes and additions we made to the default MagicMirror Module made by MichMich is detailed Below

  -We fixed the date/time, so now it now displays the correct Irish time
  -Updated the news module to give us irish news from an irish source instead of American news.
  -Changed the weather module and weather update module to provide Irish weather forcast for currently and following week.
  -Created a new module to show Sea Data such as Sea Tempeture, Wave Height and Wind Speed.
  -Adjusted the compliments Module to provide more project related welcomes.

<H2>Main Files</H2>
<p4>
  The most important files for looking at this project would be in the modules and config folders as these are the files we interacted with most. The config.js was changed around a lot over the course of the project to include all the different modules we researched on to change and the new modules we had to create. Going from 0 knowledge on the language to know understanding enough to be able to read and edit and create our own modules and applications. The other folder we mainly interacted with is the modules folder as in there we created a couple new modules like Sea-temp and edited a lot of the default modules like the weather.
