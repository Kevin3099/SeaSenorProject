<H1>Sea Sensor Project - Trysten & Kevin</H1>
<p> Github Repo was created, MagicMirror was cloned into it.
A new config file was created, letting magicmirror actually run.
We fixed the date/time, so now it displays irish time.
The news module give us irish news from an irish source instead of somewhere else.
We have sea data displaying on MagicMirror, using a module we implemented called sea-temp.
We tried to implement an iFrame module to display a map on MagicMirror, but couldnt get it to display google maps.
Next we finalized and finished the sea information module so it displays all the sea data we wanted to see.</p>
