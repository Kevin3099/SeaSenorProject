<H1>Sea Sensor Project - Trysten Afrin & Kevin Power</H1>
<p> 
  Github Repo was created, MagicMirror was cloned into it.
  A new config file was created, letting magicmirror actually run.
  We fixed the date/time, so now it displays irish time.
  The news module give us irish news from an irish source instead of somewhere else.
  We have sea data displaying on MagicMirror, using a module we implemented called sea-temp.
  We tried to implement an iFrame module to display a map on MagicMirror, but couldnt get it to display google maps.
  Next we finalized and finished the sea information module so it displays all the sea data we wanted to see.
  We then tried to add a module called "MMM-google-route", but couldnt get google maps to actually display for us.
</p>

<H3> Things we need to fix: </H3>
<p>
  Change date/time to display irish time.
  Get the MMM-google-route module to display google maps.
  Attempt to implement a module for displaying an image of the device.
  If time allows us, we wish to add a comment section for people to leave feedback and info.
